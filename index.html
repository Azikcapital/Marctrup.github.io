                    <h5>PROFESSIONAL PROFILE</h5>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I've turned an idea into a business, built teams, secured funding, and then sold it before diving into the next venture. 
                        This journey has honed my leadership skills and deepened my appreciation for the individuals, 
                        teams, and shareholders who have been pivotal in the growth of the businesses.</p>

                        <p>Now, I'm transitioning from launching businesses to focusing in on the areas I'm interested in. I'm expanding my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
                            Learning by enrolling in courses at Said Business School Oxford University and Imperial College. My goal is to grasp this technology in order to guide Azik Capital’s future 
                            investment decisions together with the roles I hope to find,  helping businesses develop their plans in this new and fast-evolving landscape.</p>
