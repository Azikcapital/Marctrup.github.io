            <h2>Marc Trup</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I've turned an idea into a business, built teams, secured funding, and then sold it before diving into the next venture. 
                This journey has honed my leadership skills and deepened my appreciation for the individuals, 
                teams, and shareholders who have been pivotal in the growth of the businesses.</p>

            <p>I am now focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by enrolling in courses at Said Business School Oxford University and Imperial College. 
                My goal is to grasp this technology in order to guide Azik Capitalâ€™s future investment decisions together with roles helping early stage AI businesses 
                develop their plans.</p>
